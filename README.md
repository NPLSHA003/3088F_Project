# 3088F_Project

This project is a light sensing project that detects light intensity as an external environmental stimulus using an analogue sensor as an ADC input then the signal is fed to a digital sensor which will function as a communication port to the microcontroller using a communication protocol that both the microcontroller and digital sensor recognize so that the information carried by the incoming signal is decoded appropriately.

This light sensing unit is a HAT that will be built as an autonomous logging daughter that attaches on top of the STM32Discovery board. This will be achieved by using PCB design techniques and pinpointing the dimensions of HAT to embed on the STM32Discovery board.

The HAT can be used in ambient light sensing to adjust brightness, security to detect intrusion and agriculture to determine how much direct sunlight plants need for photosynthesis. 

For this project we also needed to build our own portable power supply.
